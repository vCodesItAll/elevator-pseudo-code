## Functionality 


### Simple user experience:

 - I press the button to go up or down 
 - I enter the cab (the elevator room)
 - I push the floor I want to go to
 - I exit the elevator

 ### **User Story**:
 <u>As a user</u> <u>I want to</u> *be transported to a different floor* <u>so that I</u> *can continue to my desired location.*
