## Functionality 


### Simple user experience:

 - I press the button to go up or down 
 - I enter the cab (the elevator room)
 - I push the floor I want to go to
 - I exit the elevator

 ### **User Story**:
 *As a user I want to be transported to a different floor so that I can continue to my desired location*
